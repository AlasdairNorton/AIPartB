DONE:
- Imported code from part 1
- Altered board representation to use integers (-1 invalid, 0 empty, 1 white, 2 black)
	rather than characters, according to piece interface.
- Made a basic random move generator
- Implemented OpponentMove, Init, Printboard, getWinner in Ajnorton.java
(GetWinner not tested)

Currently, will play against itself, putting pieces down at random.
